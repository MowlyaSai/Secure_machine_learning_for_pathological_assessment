## for executing the code follow this steps
STEP-1:
1.run random_forest code in google colab or jupyter notebook
2.after running successfully it generates a .pkl file in which the whole code i.e random_forest code will be stored
3.download this and store it in a new folder (let we named it as project_folder)
*NOTE:before running this make sure that the libraries used here are installed properly or not

STEP-2:(same process as above)
1.run XGBoost code in google colab or jupyter notebook
2.after running successfully it generates a .pkl file in which the whole code i.e XGBoost code will be stored
3.download this and store it in a new folder (let we named it as project_folder)
*NOTE:before running this make sure that the libraries used here are installed properly or not

STEP-3:
1.app.py code is stored in a notebook and save it as app.py extension and the file type is all files
2.this file must be stored in the same location where above 2 ml models codes .pkl files are stored

STEP-4:
1.open command prompt
2.install streamlit by using the command pip install streamlit
3.after installed successfully change path into the folder where the above three files are saved
4.now run command : streamlit run app.py

STEP-5:
A webpage is opened give the input values and click the button send for prediction 
then it displays the final prediction output
